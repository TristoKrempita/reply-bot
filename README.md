## Description

A bot that adds reply funcionality to Discord.
Many chatting platforms have a reply feature where you can specify which message you are replying to when chatting
Discord lacks that feature
This bot uses webhooks to mimic a user (aside from having [BOT] next to their nickname and their nickname being white) and utilizes rich embeds 
to display basic information and a hyperlink to the message itself
