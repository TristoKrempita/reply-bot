# Reply Bot

Reply bot began its life September 27th 2018 with the simple idea of adding the reply functionality to discord using `!reply [message_id]`. The functionality grew fast and became the most used command on our server so, as the part of Discords bot competition I revamped the way it was used to include a single emoji reaction to select your reply message.
I was later contacted by Discord to be a part of the [_Early verified bot developer_](https://blog.discord.com/the-future-of-bots-on-discord-4e6e050ab52e) program and the bot was soon used on over 1000 servers.
As of December 19th 2020 the reply feature [is a part of Discord](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-reply-on-discord), so as my yearly AWS subscription comes to an end so does Reply Bot's lifecycle.
I would like to thank everyone that was a part of a (what I consider successful) life cycle of a user made mod.
Source code will remain available but will not be updated to newer versions. If anyone wishes to use it on their own private server, they're more than welcome.
